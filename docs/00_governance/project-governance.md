# Project Governance

## Scope

MyPhoneCheck is a project governed by the shared constitution repository and by this project-level applied governance.

This repository stores:

- applied project rules
- project architecture records
- implementation and validation documents
- project history

It does not store the cross-project constitution itself.

## Constitution Source

- Constitution repository local path: `C:\Users\user\Dev\ollanvin\web`
- Constitution repository remote: `https://github.com/ollanvin/web`
- Constitution document baseline: `CONSTITUTION.md`

MyPhoneCheck must align to the constitution repository, but project-specific implementation documents remain inside this repository only.

## Fixed Project Principles

- MyPhoneCheck is a 190-country shared single-core system.
- Country-specific feature branching is prohibited in the global core.
- The fixed layers are `Global Core`, `Country Policy Layer`, and `Presentation Layer`.
- `CallCheck Core Engine` is the only judgment core.
- `MessageCheck` is an extension path into the same core, not an independent engine.
- `PushCheck` remains disabled.
- The app does not make the final user judgment. It shows evidence.
- The user remains the final decision-maker.
- Contact saving and relationship management remain separate.
- Unsaved numbers must still support local relationship profiles.
- Only measured on-device data may be shown.
- Search-result status must use direct fixed wording only.

## Documentation Standard

Project documents must live under `docs/` and be classified by purpose.

Standard folders:

- `docs/00_governance/`
- `docs/01_architecture/`
- `docs/02_product/`
- `docs/03_engineering/`
- `docs/04_operations/`
- `docs/05_quality/`
- `docs/06_history/`

Rules:

- Do not leave implementation notes scattered in the repository root or feature folders.
- Do not mix constitution documents with project implementation documents.
- Keep work instructions, architecture, validation, and history as separate records.
- Keep temporary local notes and duplicate floating artifacts out of the project tree.
